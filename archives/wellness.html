              <p>
                Over the years, the “Year Of” program has provided a framework for looking at the relationship between science and religion, humans and our environments, the relationships between self and society, methods of conflict transformation, and – this year – our wellness.
                <br />
                <br />
                During this <b>Year of Wellness</b>, we are hosting events, discussions, activities, and academic explorations of how our preconceived notions intersect with the reality of physical, mental, spiritual, economic, and relational wellness.
                <br />
                <br />
                The title provides the frame for topics that encourage academic debate as the college aims to consider:
              <ul>
                <li>How do we compose wellness?</li>
                <li>Is wellness composed merely in our relationships with food, sleep, and exercise? What about our relationships with other people?</li>
                <li>How does wellness look between friends, lovers, and family?</li>
                <li>What happens during major life transitions? What do we do to maintain wellness throughout these transitions?</li>
                <li>Is wellness a perfect ideal that we strive for, or is it found in the “good enough” moments in life?</li>
                <li>What happens in the times when wellness “hits the fan”?</li>
              </ul>
