                  What does it mean to be successful in the visual arts? How do we define success? There are infinite paths in the visual arts, whether teaching, working commercially, engaging with the gallery system, writing about art, working in the entertainment industry, etc. How artists support themselves financially is just one of the markers of success. The Year of Myth and Reality hosts a panel with four artists who work in varied fields of the visual arts. Come take part in the discussion following the presentations of these creative individuals:<br/><br/>
