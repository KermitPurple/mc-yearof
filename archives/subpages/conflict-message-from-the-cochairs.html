                            We would like to thank the Moorpark College community for their willingness to turn their attention to the topic of Conflict Transformation in the 2011-2012 school year.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We would like to share some of the comments we received from faculty at the President’s Lunch in August. Find those comments below, edited, because we were not always sure how to read them.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Conflict resolution is about agreeing to disagree…
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Put yourself in the other person’s shoes in order to see, even if not agree with, other points of view.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In conflict the goal should be to prevent escalation [of anger? Emotions?] in a situation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            “I’ll stop hearing without listening,” you might say to your conflict partner.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It’s hard to bring opposing points of view together; it’s even harder to bring opposing ways of communicating together.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is not always possible to correct a misconception.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We need rational people; we need to change irrational behavior. We need compromise.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In conflict transformation, you “learn to see others’ perspectives. Being respectful…..thinking before acting….setting boundaries, controlling impulses.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Respect is needed in classrooms.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Become aware of all facets of the conflict.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Transforming conflict could possibly making it worse.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Avoid a winner/loser reading of a dealing with a conflict.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Various people suggested how the likelihood of conflict in the classroom might be lessened.
                            <br>
                            Here are some of those suggestions:

                            <br>
                            Sometimes conflict is not between you and me; but rather between me and myself.

                            What to do with people who deny there’s even a conflict?
