                    <br />
                    “The Fuzzy Boundaries between Individual Expression and Social Responsibility” is a panel discussion on inclusiveness, communication, and balancing the right to religion with the right to speak freely. [See questions for Panelists below]
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    Here is the reasoning and questions planned for the November 1st Panel Discussion:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Reason for this event: In the wake of the Anti-Islamic film that in its intolerance for another faith prompted violent protests, we wish to provide a civil discourse on issues of religious understanding and inclusion and on the freedom to express.  This is a beginning, an opening of the conversation that we hope students will continue with each other and with their communities.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Questions for panelists:
                    <ol>
                        <li>How do we balance, as posed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the right to freedom of thought, and religion with the right to expression (see Articles from Universal Declaration below)</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>What are the limits around expression? Can you have a democracy without freedom of expression?</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>How can individual expression motivate positive social action and understanding across cultural or religious differences?</li>
                        <br />
                        <li>Does religion (and or individuals) have the power and/or responsibility to prevent violent outbursts?</li>
                    </ol>
